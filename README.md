#Documentation BrXM External Document Picker (Open UI)

Welcome to the documentation page of the External Document Picker (Re-created with Open UI)
  
Previously we have had great success with our long lasting [External Document Picker Plugin (Original)](https://github.com/bloomreach-forge/external-document-picker)

Now we feel there is a time for a new and refurbished UI to the features the external document picker offers us.
